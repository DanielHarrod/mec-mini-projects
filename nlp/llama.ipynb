      "Firstly, I think you would love \"Game of Thrones\". While it does have its dark and brutal moments, it's also an epic, sprawling fantasy with complex characters, political intrigue, and plenty of action. The world-building is incredible, and the show has a great cast. It's definitely worth a watch if you're looking for something with a similar feel to \"Lord of the Rings\".\n",
      "\n",
      "As for \"The 100\" and \"The Expanse\", I think they're both great choices. \"The 100\" is a post-apocalyptic drama that follows a group of teenagers as they try to survive in a dangerous new world. It has a lot of heart and some great characters, and the science fiction elements are really well-done. \"The Expanse\" is a sci-fi series set in the future, where humanity has colonized the solar system. It's a gripping, well-written show with some amazing visuals and a talented cast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of these shows have received critical acclaim and have a dedicated fan base, so I think you would enjoy them. However, I do want to mention that \"The Expanse\" does have some dark and brutal moments, so if you're sensitive to that kind of content, you might want to be prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other shows that you might like include \"Westworld\" (a sci-fi western with some great characters and a complex mystery to unravel), \"The Magicians\" (a fantasy series based on the book of the same name, with some great characters and a lot of humor), and \"Outlander\" (a time-traveling romance series with some great acting and some really beautiful scenery).\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope these recommendations are helpful, and I hope you find some new shows to enjoy! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n"
